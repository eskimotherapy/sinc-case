# Sinc Keyboard Case

Here are the case design files for the [Sinc](https://keeb.io/products/sinc-split-staggered-75-keyboard). The .ai files have multiple layers to toggle on/off to generate the correct set of plates/mid-layers/etc.

It's suggested to use the enclosed design.

## Plate Files

In the [plates](plates/) folder, there are DXF files of the switch plates and bottom plates. These are the same design as the FR4 plates that are sold. The switch plates are designed for 1.5-1.6mm thickness.
## Enclosed Design

In the [enclosed-case](enclosed-case/) folder, there are STL files for a design where the FR4 switch and bottom plates are used but have their sides covered. The top shell has been designed to be threaded into directly from underneath using long M2 screws.

For the Rev. 2 & 3, you will need [M2 screws that are 16mm](https://keeb.io/products/m2-screws-and-standoffs?variant=39401487040606) in length. For Rev. 1, due to the thicker mid layer, you will need 20mm screws.

## Older Design

The original case design can be found in the [older-design](older-design/) folder. The design there can be used to make a stacked acrylic case
